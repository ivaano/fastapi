fastapi
=======

Fast api development with slim, monolog and phpunit.

This is a simple project to get you started writing an api.

It uses Slim Framework, Monolog Logger, and the simple-json middleware for slim to send
the responses in json.

You can use this inside a folder or in your document root as it is, adding rewrite rules is optional.

To get started just clone this repo, add your routes in /src/app.php and add your business logic in /src/Models
