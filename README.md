Fastapi
=======

This is a simple project to get you started writing your api.

It uses [Slim Framework](http://www.slimframework.com/)., [Monolog Logger](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog), and the [simple-json](https://github.com/entomb/slim-json-api) 
middleware for slim to send the responses in json.

You can use this inside a folder or in your document root as it is, adding rewrite rules is optional.

To get started just clone this repo, add your routes in [/src/app.php](https://github.com/ivaano/fastapi/blob/master/src/app.php) 
and add your business logic in [/src/Models](https://github.com/ivaano/fastapi/blob/master/src/Models/FastModel.php)
